insertion Sort algorithm implementation

High Level Description:
For every element in the given list, find it's correct index by iterating
backwards and finding a slot. This forms a sorted array from 0 to i.

Time Complexity:
Every element is visited, which contributes O(n). Swapping backwards takes
O(n/2) time on average, meaning that the total complexity is O(n^2)
